A group challenge. I worked in a group of four to complete this challenge of producing an app, 
where by the user can upload an image of their choice, upload it and view it in a seperate page.

We used node.js, express, handlebars and we chose mutler as our express middleware tool.

A very challenging but rewarding challenge. I plan to build on this going forward to add more features.
